# Run Length Encoding

Inspired by a tweet, here is some code and tests for solving a Python interview question in Ruby:

```python
# Example input:
"aaaabbbcca"

# Expected output:
[("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)]
```

See the corresponding blog post (wip...)

## Setup

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```
